<p>This week was a bit slow, working on a particular element of the trailer which is the overlay text. I wanted a nice font and some nice effect to make it stand out, and since I&#39;m on full DIY mode, I need to do something more that provided presets from open source programs. As usual, I ended up using some combination of distance fields and simplex noise. I found out a really nice font called <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Milonga">Milonga</a>. 

<p>The way it works is roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initialise an empty image with 2x the size, so that I can do some nice downscaling in the end for supersampling antialiasing.</li>
<li>Render text using desired font to desired position in an image, with plenty of padding</li>
<li>Calculate distance field based on distance to the opaque font pixels</li>
<li>Calculate some 3D FBM simplex noise (pixel_x, pixel_y, time)</li>
<li>Combine the FBM and the distance field to get a fuzzy noisy wispy text effect, still single channel</li>
<li>Modulate to obtain other channels (resulting in the blueish hue)</li>
</ul>
<p>Still working on things like text placement, font size, fade in/out effects/animations etc, so that I can put all the trailer related text procedurally into the video segments. </p>
